# Project conventions for AI agents

Invoice approval demo app: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API with a small static web UI.

## Layout

- `backend/src/InvoiceApp.Domain`: business rules, no web or storage code. `ApprovalService` owns the invoice lifecycle (Draft, PendingApproval, Approved, Rejected).
- `backend/src/InvoiceApp.Api`: controllers, sign-in (`Auth/`), in-memory repository, and the web UI under `wwwroot/`.
- `backend/tests/InvoiceApp.Tests`: xUnit tests, one test class per class under test, named `<ClassUnderTest>Tests`.
- `e2e`: Playwright end-to-end tests (`tests/`) and page objects (`pages/`).
- `docs/use-cases`: short briefs for features we may build.

## Approval rules

- A `Manager` may approve invoices up to `50,000`.
- A `Director` may approve invoices up to `500,000`.
- Anything above `500,000` requires two distinct approvers, and the second approver must be a `Director`.
- The same user may never count as both approvers on one invoice.
- A rejected approval attempt must return a clear reason and leave the invoice completely unchanged.
- The last two rules are the highest-risk edge cases: they are easy to implement in a superficially correct but incorrect way. Tests must assert both the rejection reason and the unchanged invoice state.

## Conventions

- Controllers live in `Controllers/`, one per resource, route `api/[controller]`. Request bodies are `record` types declared inside the controller.
- Controllers inherit `ApiControllerBase` and use `Handle(...)` so service errors map to 404, 409 and 400.
- Every endpoint is behind sign-in. Restrict actions with `[RequireRole("...")]`: destructive actions are Admin only, approvals are Approver or Admin.
- Business rules go in the Domain project, never in controllers.
- Register services in `Program.cs`. Repositories are interfaces in Domain with an in-memory implementation in Api.
- Every new rule or endpoint needs tests. Use `FakeInvoiceRepository` in tests.
- Use clear names; no one-letter variables or `flag` parameters.
- End-to-end tests use page objects and role-based locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`), never CSS or XPath selectors.
- Do not mutate invoice state when a business rule fails. On invalid approval attempts, assert that amount, status, approver, decision time, and decision note remain unchanged.

## Commands

- Run the app: `dotnet run --project backend/src/InvoiceApp.Api` then open http://localhost:5000
- Run the tests: `dotnet test backend/InvoiceApp.sln`
- Run end-to-end tests: `cd e2e && npm install && npx playwright install chromium && npm test`

## Demo accounts (not real credentials)

- `demo.approver` / `ChangeMe123!` (role Approver)
- `demo.admin` / `ChangeMe123!` (role Admin)

## Review expectations

- Keep business logic in the Domain layer only.
- Validate both success and failure paths.
- Ensure rejected approvals produce a clear, actionable reason.
- Ensure failed validations do not change invoice state.
- Prefer explicit assertions over assumptions; a passing test must prove the rule, not just the exception type.

## Never

- Commit real credentials, tokens or customer data.
- Add business logic to `Program.cs` or controllers.
